      </div></div><p>This is my 'Hire Me' portfolio, designed to showcase my skills and aspirations. It offers a more comprehensive view of who I am compared to a traditional resume. I believe a portfolio like this goes beyond showcasing technical abilities; it also provides insight into my character. Completed earlier this year, this project presented challenges that encouraged me to revisit and refine my knowledge of HTML and CSS tags.</p></th>

    </div></div> <p>By creating a page about someone who inspires me, I was able to redefine my HTML and CSS skills. This page shows who I am a fan of and enjoy listening to. The main challenges in this project revolved around the decisions of selecting the subject of inspiration and determining the optimal format and style for the page.</p></th>

    <div class="text">jQuery Adventure Game</div></a>
  </div></div><p>With the use of jQuery, I created a short game where the user has to make choices inorder to navigate through the story. I found this project very difficult at first because I wasn't confident in my jQuery skills. This was the first time I mainly focused on jQuery and now I feel much more comfortable with it. </p></th>

    </div></div><p>I created a quiz that tells the user what Disney character they are  most similar to based off of three questions they will answer In this project I had to keep several things in mind. For example, I had to consider that the user may make typos or forget to answer a question. In this project, I felt most challneged by displaying an error message.  </p></th>

      <div class="text">Photo Gallery </div></a>
    </div></div><p>In this project, I made a website to show different desserts. People can add pictures of desserts and say something about them. They can also remove the last picture they added. Making the website look nice and letting people do things with the pictures was fun. It was tricky to make sure the first pictures always stay there while letting people add more. Also, making sure the buttons work right and checking if people typed things correctly was tough. Overall, I learned a lot about making websites and solving problems.  </p></th>

    </div></div><p>As a group, we created a website to show the social issues that society is facing currently. We focused on AI's impact on the job market and also provided solutions to address the issue. We used Replit to present our idea and introduce the topic. We also made a figma to present a app idea called "Eudaimonia", will allow users to ask questions, share insights, and get advice from fellow users. Users will be able to provide assistance and guidance to individuals, businesses, and policymakers navigating the complexities of the AI-driven economy. </p></th>
